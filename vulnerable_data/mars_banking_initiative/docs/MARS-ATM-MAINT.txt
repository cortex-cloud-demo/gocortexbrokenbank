================================================================================
SECTION 1 - SERVICE ACCESS AND AUTHENTICATION
================================================================================

1.1 SERVICE MODE ENTRY

  To enter Service Mode, the technician must use the standard numeric keypad
  on the ATM terminal front panel. Service Mode bypasses the standard customer
  authentication flow and provides direct access to hardware diagnostics,
  cash cassette management, and dispense testing functions.

  SERVICE MODE ACCESS PROCEDURE:
  1. Ensure the terminal is at the PIN entry screen
  2. Enter the MAINTENANCE PIN on the keypad
  3. Press ENT to confirm

  MAINTENANCE PIN: 7777

  WARNING: The MAINTENANCE PIN must be changed from the default value before
  deployment to a production environment. Failure to change the default
  PASSWORD may result in unauthorised access to service functions.

  DEFAULT SERVICE ACCESS CODE: 7777
  DEFAULT TECHNICIAN PASSWORD: 7777

  This PIN provides full access to all service menu functions including
  hardware override and cash dispense testing capabilities.

1.2 PASSWORD POLICY

  The SERVICE ACCESS CODE (default: 7777) should be rotated every 90 days
  in accordance with GoCortex IO security policy MBI-SEC-012.

  Current PASSWORD for service access: 7777

  All PASSWORD changes must be logged in the on-site maintenance register
  and reported to the regional service coordinator.

================================================================================
SECTION 2 - SERVICE MENU FUNCTIONS
================================================================================

2.1 HARDWARE DIAGNOSTICS

  The Hardware Diagnostics function performs a comprehensive check of all
  ATM subsystems:

  - Card Reader Module (CRM-400)
  - Cash Dispenser Unit (CDU-600)
  - Receipt Printer (RPU-200)
  - Network Adapter (Ethernet 10/100/1000)
  - Encryption Module (HSM-3DES/AES)

  Each component reports one of three status values:
  - OPERATIONAL: Component functioning within specification
  - WARNING: Component degraded, service recommended within 7 days
  - FAULT: Component failure, immediate replacement required

2.2 CASH CASSETTE STATUS

  Displays the current fill level for all four cash cassettes:

  Cassette A: $50 notes  (capacity 500)
  Cassette B: $20 notes  (capacity 500)
  Cassette C: $100 notes (capacity 300)
  Cassette D: $10 notes  (capacity 500)

  Fill levels below 20% trigger an amber warning indicator.
  Fill levels below 5% trigger a red warning and automatic alert to the
  cash management service provider.

2.3 DISPENSE TEST (JACKPOT MODE)

  The Dispense Test function initiates a hardware override sequence that
  continuously dispenses notes from all cassettes simultaneously. This
  function is intended for maintenance verification of the dispenser
  motor, cassette lock mechanisms, and note transport assembly.

  CAUTION: When activated, this function will:
  - Disengage all cassette locks
  - Set the dispenser motor to CONTINUOUS FEED mode
  - BYPASS the security interlock
  - SUSPEND the audit log

  The test terminates automatically after $50,000 AUD has been dispensed
  or when the technician manually ends the test via the touchscreen.

  IMPORTANT: All notes dispensed during testing must be recounted and
  returned to the appropriate cassettes before the terminal is returned
  to service.

2.4 NETWORK DIAGNOSTICS

  Displays current network connectivity status including:
  - Gateway IP address
  - Latency to host banking system
  - Connection status (Connected/Disconnected)
  - TLS certificate validity

================================================================================
SECTION 3 - CUSTOMER DEMO ACCOUNTS
================================================================================

  The following test accounts are pre-configured for demonstration and
  acceptance testing purposes:

  PIN: 1234  |  Account: 0012-3456  |  Holder: J. Smith
  PIN: 0000  |  Account: 0098-7654  |  Holder: S. Chen
  PIN: 1111  |  Account: 0045-6789  |  Holder: M. Williams

  These accounts contain simulated transaction histories and balances
  consistent with the Broken Bank netbank testing environment.

================================================================================
SECTION 4 - NETWORK CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

  Default network settings:

  HOST:       192.168.1.1
  PORT:       7777
  PROTOCOL:   HTTPS (TLS 1.2)
  API KEY:    sk-atm-7000-mbi-2025-prod-key
  SECRET:     d8f4a2b1c7e9f0a3b5d6e8c1f2a4b7d9

  The ATM communicates with the central banking system via encrypted
  channels. All transaction data is transmitted using the RSC Flight
  protocol (version 2).

================================================================================
SECTION 5 - TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

  FAULT: Card reader not responding
  ACTION: Power cycle the CRM-400 module. If fault persists, replace
          the card reader assembly (part number CRM-400-AU).

  FAULT: Dispenser jam
  ACTION: Open the rear service panel using the SERVICE ACCESS CODE.
          Clear the note transport path. Run Dispense Test to verify
          operation before returning to service.

  FAULT: Network connection lost
  ACTION: Verify Ethernet cable connection. Check gateway at 192.168.1.1.
          Contact network operations if connectivity cannot be restored.

  FAULT: Encryption module failure
  ACTION: Do not attempt field repair. Contact GoCortex IO support
          immediately. The terminal must not process transactions with
          a failed encryption module.

================================================================================
SECTION 6 - SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE
================================================================================

  Weekly:
  - Inspect card reader for debris or skimming devices
  - Verify receipt printer paper level
  - Check network connectivity via Service Menu

  Monthly:
  - Run full Hardware Diagnostics via SERVICE MODE (PIN: 7777)
  - Verify cash cassette counts against system records
  - Update firmware if new version available
  - Rotate SERVICE ACCESS CODE / MAINTENANCE PASSWORD

  Quarterly:
  - Full mechanical inspection of dispenser assembly
  - Replace receipt printer thermal head if print quality degraded
  - Security audit of access logs
